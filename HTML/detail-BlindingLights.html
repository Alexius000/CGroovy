  [Intro]
  Yeah

  [Verse 1]
  I've been tryna call
  I've been on my own for long enough
  Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
  I'm goin' through withdrawals
  You don't even have to do too much
  You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

  [Pre-Chorus]
  I look around and
  Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
  No one's around to judge me (Oh)
  I can't see clearly when you're gone

  [Chorus]
  I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
  No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
  I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
  Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
  Hey, hey, hey

  [Verse 2]
  I'm running out of time
  'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
  So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  The city's cold and empty (Oh)
  No one's around to judge me (Oh)
  I can't see clearly when you're gone

  [Chorus]
  I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
  No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
  I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
  Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

  [Bridge]
  I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
  I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
  Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

  [Chorus]
  I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
  No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
  Hey, hey, hey

  [Post-Chorus]
  Hey, hey, hey

  [Outro]
  I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
  No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
